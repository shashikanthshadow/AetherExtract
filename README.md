Follow these steps to get your AetherExtract chatbot up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: Make sure you have a compatible Python version installed.

Google Gemini API Key: Obtain an API key from  or your Google Cloud Console.

Antiword (for .doc files): If you plan to process .doc files, you might need to install antiword on your system.

On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install antiword

On macOS (with Homebrew): brew install antiword

On Windows: You'll need to  and add it to your system's PATH.

### 2. Clone the Repository

(Replace YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE with your actual repository URL.)

### 3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries using pip:

### 5. Set up your Gemini API Key

Create a file named .env in the root of your mini_rag_chatbot/ directory (at the same level as requirements.txt).

Add your Gemini API key to this file:

IMPORTANT: Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key. Ensure there are no spaces around the = sign.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Follow these steps to start your chatbot:

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Open your terminal, navigate to the mini_rag_chatbot/ directory, activate your virtual environment, and run the FastAPI server:

(Leave this terminal window open; the server will be running in the background.)

### 2. Open the Frontend in your Browser

Open your web browser and go to the following address:

You should now see the AetherExtract chatbot interface.

## üí° Usage Examples & Demonstrations

Here are some examples of AetherExtract in action. Ensure you upload a suitable document (like the sample AI/ML content provided previously) for these queries.

### 1. Initial Load & Document Upload

This GIF demonstrates launching the chatbot and successfully uploading a document.

[Image: GIF 1: Initial Load & Document Upload] (assets/GeneralConcise%20Response%20Test%20(Default%203-5%20Sentences).gif)

(Description: Shows the browser loading http://127.0.0.1:8000/, then the user clicking the folder icon, selecting a document file, and seeing the "Document processed successfully!" message.)

### 2. Concise Response Example

This GIF shows how AetherExtract provides brief, 3-5 sentence answers for general questions.

(Description: User types "What is Artificial Intelligence?", hits Send. Chatbot responds with a concise overview of AI and a single source.)

### 3. Detailed Response Example

This GIF highlights AetherExtract's ability to give comprehensive answers when more detail is requested.

[Image: GIF 3: Detailed Response] (assets/DetailedComprehensive%20Response%20Test%20(Explicitly%20Asking%20for%20Detail).gif)

(Description: User types "Explain in detail the different types of machine learning.", hits Send. Chatbot responds with a multi-paragraph explanation of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and a single source.)

### 4. Reset Functionality & Out-of-Context Handling

This GIF demonstrates clearing the chatbot and its appropriate response to questions outside the document's scope.

[Image: GIF 4: Reset & Out-of-Context] (assets/I cannot find the answer.gif)

(Description: User clicks the üîÑ (reset) button, confirms reset. Chatbot clears. User then types "What is the capital of France?", hits Send. Chatbot responds with "I cannot find the answer to that question in the provided document.")

## üß™ Test Queries for Your Chatbot

Upload your 5-6 page AI/ML sample document (or a similar relevant document) and try these queries:

General/Concise Response Test (Default 3-5 Sentences):

"What is Artificial Intelligence?"

"Define Machine Learning briefly."

"Explain deep learning simply."

Detailed/Comprehensive Response Test (Explicitly Asking for Detail):

"Explain in detail the different types of machine learning."

"Provide a comprehensive explanation of how Computer Vision works."

"Summarize the future directions of AI research in detail."

Specific Information Extraction:

"Who introduced the Turing Test and when?"

"What is the role of the Transformer architecture in NLP?"

"List some common tasks in Computer Vision."

"I cannot find the answer" Test (Out of Context):

"What is the capital of France?"

"Who won the last Super Bowl?"

"Tell me about quantum physics."

## üìÇ Project Structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

ModuleNotFoundError or DefaultCredentialsError:

Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).

Verify your .env file is in the root directory and GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE" is correctly set without extra spaces or invalid characters.

Confirm your API key is active and has permissions for the gemini-2.0-flash and text-embedding-004 models in your Google AI Studio dashboard.

500 Internal Server Error or "Could not extract text from the document":

The document might be image-only (scanned), encrypted, or corrupted.

Try with a simple, digitally created .pdf, .docx, or .txt file first.

For .doc files, ensure antiword is installed on your system if docx2txt encounters issues (see Setup Instructions for antiword).

429 Quota Exceeded:

You've hit your free-tier usage limits for the Gemini API.

Wait for your quota to reset (check Google AI Studio for specific reset times).

Consider  on your Google Cloud project to increase your quotas.

Frontend not loading (seeing JSON):

Ensure you're navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and not /upload-document or /chat directly.

Clear your browser cache if CSS/JS changes aren't appearing.
