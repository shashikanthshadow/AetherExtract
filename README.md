## üí° Usage Examples & Demonstrations

Here are some examples of AetherExtract in action. Ensure you upload a suitable document (like the sample AI/ML content provided previously) for these queries.

### 1. Initial Load & Document Upload

This GIF demonstrates launching the chatbot and successfully uploading a document.

![Image: GIF 1: Initial Load & Document Upload](assets/SpecificInformationExtraction.gif)

(Description: Shows the browser loading http://127.0.0.1:8000/, then the user clicking the folder icon, selecting a document file, and seeing the "Document processed successfully!" message.)

### 2. Concise Response Example

This GIF shows how AetherExtract provides brief, 3-5 sentence answers for general questions.

![Image: GIF 2: Concise Response](assets/GeneralConciseResponseTest.gif)

(Description: User types "What is Artificial Intelligence?", hits Send. Chatbot responds with a concise overview of AI and a single source.)

### 3. Detailed Response Example

This GIF highlights AetherExtract's ability to give comprehensive answers when more detail is requested.

![Image: GIF 3: Detailed Response](assets/DetailedComprehensiveResponseTest.gif)

(Description: User types "Explain in detail the different types of machine learning.", hits Send. Chatbot responds with a multi-paragraph explanation of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and a single source.)

### 4. Reset Functionality & Out-of-Context Handling

This GIF demonstrates clearing the chatbot and its appropriate response to questions outside the document's scope.

![Image: GIF 4: Reset & Out-of-Context](assets/Icannotfindtheanswer.gif)

(Description: User clicks the üîÑ (reset) button, confirms reset. Chatbot clears. User then types "What is the capital of France?", hits Send. Chatbot responds with "I cannot find the answer to that question in the provided document.")



## üß™ Test Queries for Your Chatbot

Upload your 5-6 page AI/ML sample document (or a similar relevant document) and try these queries:

### General/Concise Response Test (Default 3-5 Sentences):

"What is Artificial Intelligence?"

"Define Machine Learning briefly."

"Explain deep learning simply."

### Detailed/Comprehensive Response Test (Explicitly Asking for Detail):

"Explain in detail the different types of machine learning."

"Provide a comprehensive explanation of how Computer Vision works."

"Summarize the future directions of AI research in detail."

### Specific Information Extraction:

"Who introduced the Turing Test and when?"

"What is the role of the Transformer architecture in NLP?"

"List some common tasks in Computer Vision."

### "I cannot find the answer" Test (Out of Context):

"What is the capital of France?"

"Who won the last Super Bowl?"

"Tell me about quantum physics."

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
### ‚ùó ModuleNotFoundError or DefaultCredentialsError
- Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Verify your .env file is in the root directory, and contains:

``` env

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```
Make sure there are no extra spaces or invalid characters.

- Confirm your API key is active and has permissions for:

 - gemini-2.0-flash

 - text-embedding-004 (Check this in your Google AI Studio dashboard)

### ‚ùó500 Internal Server Error or ‚ÄúCould not extract text from the document‚Äù
- The document might be:

 - Image-only (scanned)

 - Encrypted

 - Corrupted

- Try using a digitally created .pdf, .docx, or .txt file first.

- For .doc files:

  - Ensure antiword is installed if docx2txt fails. (See setup instructions for installing antiword.)

### ‚ùó429 Quota Exceeded
- You've hit your free-tier usage limits for the Gemini API.

- Wait for your quota to reset (check the reset time in your Google AI Studio).

- Consider upgrading or increasing quota on your Google Cloud project.
### ‚ùóFrontend not loading (seeing raw JSON)
- Make sure you are navigating to:

```cpp
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Do not open /upload-document or /chat directly in the browser.

 - Clear your browser cache if you don‚Äôt see updated CSS or JS changes.
